                        Visit Nidarosdomen, the world's northernmost medieval cathedral and the end point of the St. Olav Ways pilgrimage. 
                        The cathedral was built on the the burial site of St. Olav, the Norwegian king who became Norway's patron saint.

                        Wander through the narrow alleys and colorful houses in the historic Bakklandet neighborhood.
                        The neighborhood has been preserved since the 17th century and is a great place to visit local cafes and restaurants.
                        Bakklandet is home to the world's first bicycle lift, Trampe. Grab a coffee from one of the cafes and enjoy the entertainment of tourists trying to get up the hill with Trampe, with varying degrees of success.
                        From Bakklandet, stroll over to Gamle Bybro, Trondheim's famous old town bridge, and view the colorful wharf buildings that have been preserved from the 18th century.

                        Friluftsliv is the Norwegian belief that life is best lived outside. 
                        With being situated on the fjord and the Bymarka nature reserve nearby, Trondheim offers plenty of opportunities to get out and enjoy nature. 
                        Whether its going for a hike in Bymarka, going for a swim in the fjord, or grilling out at Korsvika. 
                        If you're lucky, you might even be able to catch the northern lights dancing across the fjord!
